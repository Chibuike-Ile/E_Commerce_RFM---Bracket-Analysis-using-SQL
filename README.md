# E_Commerce_RFM_and_Bracket_Analysis_using-SQL

## AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT.

The aim of this project is to segment customers based on Recency (when they last made a purchase), Frequency (how often they purchase), and Monetary Value (how much they spend), and to determine which products are frequently ordered together by the same customers.

**Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM) analysis.**

There is no information on the dataset regarding the customers apart from the purchase address. I used the purchase address for the customers identification.

**Most recent purchase date for each customer (Recency):** I set today's date as 2020/01/01 as the maximum date in the dataset is 2019/12/31.

**RFM_SCORES:** I set today's date as 2020/01/01 as the maximum date in the dataset is 2019/12/31. This is to get the recency score as seen in the table below.

**RFM Bracket:** I group the RFM scores into brackets from 5 to 1, with 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest as seen in the table below.

**Average RFM score:** I concatenate the RFM bracket as RFM Cells and then get the average of the RFM Cells

**RFM Grouping:**  The table below shows the **RFM Grouping**, **number of customers that falls in each group**, **Total Sales** and **Average Sales per Customer** generated by each RFM group

**Excel Conditional formatting:**  I used color scale (Green- Yellow - Red ) to highlight the high, medium and low values in each columns. This will help users to quickly identify high, medium and low values. Also, it helps to identify the trends in each column,  helps in comparing the valves and makes it easier to understand.

### Findings & Recommendations:

**The RFM Group 5:** These are the top 5 starts customers. They are small 6% (8799) of the total customers but delivers approximately £6.4m, 19% in sales. Their average sales per customer 51% (£724.94) is highest among all group.

**Recommendation:** There is need to retain and encourage these customers. Retention campaigns, early access offers, loyalty rewards and promotions will be of help.

**Group 3 & 4:** Group 4 makes the highest total sales which is approximately £14.4M, while Group 3 makes approximately £11M which is the second to the highest. Group 3 & 4 accounts for 44% of average sales per customer and 74% of the total sales.

**Recommendation:** The company should run targeted campaigns (e.g. emails, discounts) in order to increase their frequency and possibly push them toward Group 5.

**Group 1 is at risk segment.** They have very low average sales per customer (£7.13) and they account for only 0.3% of the total sales.

**Recommendation:** The Company should run win-back campaigns, surveys to know reasons for drop off.

**BRACKET ANALYSIS:** Products frequently ordered together by the same customers and number of times they are purchase together.

### Findings & Recommendations:

Smartphones are frequently purchased with it's charging cables.

- The company should offer pre-package bundles (e.g. smartphones + it's charging cable) at a slightly discount price.
- They should use product B as an additional purchase recommendation when product A is added to the cart.
- These insights will help them in stocking physical shops, frequently paired products should be stocked together.
- Email campaigns could be created that recommend accessories companion products.
